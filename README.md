# Hi, I'm Bharat Pal 👋

Backend engineer focused on building scalable, reliable, and high‑performance systems. Currently working on cloud security products, distributed control planes, and automation tooling.

## 🌐 What I Work On

- **Backend & Control Plane Engineering**
  - Design and development of control plane components for cloud security platforms (ZIA/ZPA).
  - Experience with distributed architectures and consensus protocols (e.g., RAFT).
  - Strong focus on API design, reliability, and observability.

- **APIs & Services**
  - RESTful API development and integration.
  - Experience with Java/Tomcat–based API layers: resources, services, DAOs, controllers, and servlets.
  - Golang services for orchestration and inventory workflows.

- **Database & Data Integrity**
  - Production‑grade PL/SQL patches for high‑impact customer issues.
  - Hands‑on work with schema understanding, data migrations, and safety checks (pre/post validation).
  - Focus on correctness, rollback strategies, and regression safety.

- **Tooling & Automation**
  - Config parsing tools to validate tenant configurations at scale (50K+ tenants/hour).
  - Pattern‑based alerting and monitoring tools using traffic patterns and z‑score–style analysis.
  - Python multithreading for high‑throughput data processing.

- **Quality & Testing**
  - Engineered comprehensive unit test suites in Go for orchestration services, significantly improving code coverage and reducing regression risk.
  - Emphasis on testability, clean abstractions, and quality gates in CI/CD.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Go, Java, Python, PL/SQL, SQL  
- **Backend:** REST APIs, microservices, Tomcat, distributed systems  
- **Auth & Provisioning:** SAML, SCIM, Active Directory, form‑based auth, Kerberos  
- **Databases:** Oracle/SQL, schema design, migrations, patching  
- **Other:** Multithreading, performance tuning, monitoring, alerting

## 💡 Interests

- Distributed systems and control plane design  
- Cloud security and large‑scale multi‑tenant platforms  
- Observability, performance engineering, and automation
